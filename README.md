# Maze Solver

This project implements a maze solver that utilizes search algorithms to find the optimal path from the starting point ("A") to the goal ("B") within a given maze. The solver supports both **Depth-First Search (DFS)** and **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** to explore the maze and find a solution.

## Features

- **Solves mazes** using DFS or BFS (Default = DFS).
- **Visualizes** the maze and the solution path.
- Allows you to **create and test custom mazes**.
- **Detects invalid mazes** (e.g., missing start or goal).

## Installation

To run the maze solver on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/maze-solver.git
   cd maze-solver
   
2. pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Python 3 is recommended so check your python version
   ```bash
   python --version
